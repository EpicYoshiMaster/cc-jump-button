# Jump Button
Quite possibly the most revolutionary mod in the history of CrossCode!

Have you ever been bothered by the inability to jump whenever you please?

Do you want to fall due to your own error, rather than the game controlling your vertical height movement mechanics?

Would you like to tell the developers that their [blog post back in 2013](https://www.radicalfishgames.com/?p=1168) cannot control you and that you will show them the real power of being able to hop short distances whenever you want and then maniacally laugh each time to demonstrate that you are correct and that CrossCode most definitely should have a jump button???

Well, okay maybe not that last one, but this might be the mod for you!

This mod introduces a manual jump button, and takes away your automated jumping abilities because like, who needs those??

You can jump on controller with Cross (PlayStation) or A (Xbox).

On keyboard, the default jump bind is C, but this can be changed in Controls settings, look for the option labelled 'Jump'.
